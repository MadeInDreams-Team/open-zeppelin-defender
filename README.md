# open-zeppelin-defender

Making use of open zeppelin defender

This is the ideal setup to 

- Write Upgradeable and Secure Smart Contract
- Deploy and verify smart contract



## Installation
To install this package run

```npm install @madeindreams/open-zeppelin-defender```

You will need to rename the .envexample to .env and edit it with the following
```
MNEMONIC = " 12 words seedpharse"   (required)
ETHERSCAN = "etherscan api key"     (optional - verification only)
INFURA_ID = "infura ID"             (required)
ALCHEMY_KEY = "Alchemy ID"          (optional - mainnet fork)
MYADDRESS = "your wallet address"   (required)
```

Once you are done save the .env file.

‚ö†Ô∏è Always ensure that the .env file is listed in the .gitignore file. The content is secret and you don't want to publish it.

To Compile the smart contract use the command

```npm run compile```

to deploy your contract

```npm run deploy```

To run the test

```npm run test```

If you want to verify that contract, once deployed, head to etherscan an veryfy the proxy. It will fail but will return the address of your implementation.
Copy this address and use it to verify your implementation.

``` npx hardat verify --network rinkeby <the adress of the implementation>```


That's it. You compiled, deployed, and verified your contract.

Now head to Defender and make a proposal or look at the tasks in hardhat-config.js to deploy some Upgrades.

Make some changes the the sample contract and save it as MDEV2. run the following command

```npx hardhat upgrade```

This will upgade your contrct to the second version v2.



If you wish to use a multisignature vault to own your contract. You must uncomment the lines 33 to 37 in the hardhat.config.js file that transfer the contract ownership to the vault.
